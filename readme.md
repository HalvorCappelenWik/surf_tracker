# 🌊 Surf Tracker

A modern web app that tracks real-time surf conditions at top Portuguese beaches like Ericeira, Nazaré, and Peniche. Built as a final group project for the **Programming course at Nova School of Business and Economics (Spring 2025)**.

## 📌 What It Does

- Fetches real-time surf data (wave height, wind, swell period) from the Stormglass.io API
- Calculates a **Surf Quality Score** (0–10) based on user-defined preferences
- Dynamically displays whether current conditions are good, okay, or poor for surfing
- Sends **email alerts** when conditions are ideal (optional user opt-in)
- Responsive, modern UI built with HTML, CSS, and Flask
